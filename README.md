# Initial-algorithm-to-run-3500-robots-simultaneously
Here is an algorithm and initial clarification for working a large number of robots simultaneously, to nominate that in practice for a record number in a competition, during training with the Smart Methods Company

I have written an explanation of this, the used frequencies and the two-language communication techniques with the following attached files

Here is a picture showing my idea that I explained with the algorithm
